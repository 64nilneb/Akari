In this project, I created Akari, a grid-based game where the objective is place lightbulbs so that every single square on the grid is illuminated and no two lightbulbs can see each other.

This uses Java and the JavaFX library. The code highlights the model-view-controller design pattern as well as object oriented principles and UI/UX development.
